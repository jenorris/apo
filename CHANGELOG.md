# Changelog

All notable changes to Apo (`jenorris/apo`) are documented here. Semver tags start with **v0.1.0**.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-26

First tagged release. Tool/schema surface is now versioned toward **v1**.

### Added

- **Git contract template** — `docs/contracts/git.md` + `git-contract.schema.yaml` (telegraph backup/remote expectations; vault live copies under `system/config/`).
- **`history` MCP / RPC tool** — browse by index mtime (same as former `recent_activity`); with `path=` and an active git contract (YAML + `.git`), returns **file-level** `git log` commits. RPC: `POST /v1/history`.

### Deprecated

- **`recent_activity`** / `POST /v1/recent` — frozen aliases of `history` through the **v0.1.x** line. **Removed in v0.2.0.** Prefer `history`.

### Notes

- Git contract does not automate pull/push; engine loads YAML only to gate `history(path=…)`.
- Chunk/blame history is out of scope until a later release.
